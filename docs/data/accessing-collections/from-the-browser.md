## Accessing Collections - From the Browser 

This guide outlines the various ways you can access Collections from a browser.

### dpd.js

`dpd.js` is an auto-generated library that updates as you update the resources in your Deployd API. All you have to do is include a `<script src="/dpd.js"></script>` and you're browser has access to all your Deployd Collections.

### Angular.js

### jQuery
